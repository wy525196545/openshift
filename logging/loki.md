# Creating Log-Based Alert Rules in Loki

Loki is a system for log aggregation and querying. With Loki, you can create log-based alert rules to trigger alerts when specific patterns or conditions appear in the logs.

## Steps to Create Alert Rules

1. **Define the Alert Rule File**: Alert rule files are typically defined in YAML format. Below is an example of an alert rule file:

  ```yaml
  groups:
    - name: example
    rules:
      - alert: HighErrorRate
      expr: |
        sum(rate({job="example"} |= "error" [5m])) by (job) > 0.05
      for: 5m
      labels:
        severity: critical
      annotations:
        summary: "High error rate detected"
        description: "The error rate for job 'example' is above 5%."
  ```

2. **Load the Alert Rule File**: Load the defined alert rule file into Loki. This can be done via Loki's configuration file or API.

3. **Configure Notification Channels**: Set up notification channels to receive alerts when they are triggered. Common channels include email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.

4. **Test the Alert Rules**: Validate the alert rules in a test environment before applying them in production.

## Example

Below is a complete example demonstrating how to create and load a simple log-based alert rule:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: example
  rules:
    - alert: HighErrorRate
    expr: |
      sum(rate({job="example"} |= "error" [5m])) by (job) > 0.05
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "High error rate detected"
      description: "The error rate for job 'example' is above 5%."
```

Save the above YAML file as `alert_rules.yaml`, and reference it in the Loki configuration file:

```yaml
ruler:
  alertmanager_url: http://alertmanager:9093
  rule_path: /etc/loki/rules
  ring:
  kvstore:
    store: inmemory
  enable_api: true
```

Ensure the `alert_rules.yaml` file is located in the `/etc/loki/rules` directory.

By following these steps, you can create log-based alert rules in Loki and trigger alerts when specific patterns or conditions appear in the logs.
